Revision history for Perl extension Text::Forge.

4.1
  - Added mtime caching option. Caching choice can be specified
    as option to constructor:

      $forge = Text::Forge->new(cache => 2);

    Possible values are:

      0 - No caching; always recompile
      1 - Check for mtime changes to file (default)
      2 - Always cache; no checks done

4.0 
  - Added interpolate and trim options to constructor.
    Default behavior now is to *not* trim trailing whitespace
    or interpolate variables. If you want the old behavior, use:

      $forge = Text::Forge->new(trim => 1, interpolate => 1);
