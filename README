DESCRIPTION

  This module creates documents from templates.
  Templates are normal text files except they have a bit
  of special syntax that allows you to run perl code inside
  them.

INSTALLATION

  To install this module, move into the directory where this file is
  located and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

  This will install the module into the Perl library directory.  If
  you lack sufficient privileges for this, then you can specify an
  alternate directory like this:

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/where/I/want/it/put
        make
        make test
        make install


  See the POD documentation for further details.  Support is available
  through the Text::Forge site at http://text-forge.sourceforge.net/
